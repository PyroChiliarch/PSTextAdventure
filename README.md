 Powershell Text Adventure

This project was created to learn powershell scripting but was abandoned due to powershell performance issues.

The original idea was to create a text based game similar in a similar style to Dwarf Fortress

To run this project
Set execution policy to Unrestricted
Run the following command to set an environment variable require to make drawing smoother "$e = [char]0x1b"

There are 2 main scripts

game.ps1 contains the MainMenu
Arrow keys, Enter and Esc are menu controls

old/gameOLD2.ps1 contains the actual game code
WASD to move view
Arrow Keys to move cursor
